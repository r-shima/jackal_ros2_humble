# Setting Up the Clearpath Jackal UGV on ROS2 Humble
This README provides instructions for making the Clearpath Jackal UGV run on ROS2 Humble. Currently, the packages for the Jackal do not officially support ROS2 Humble; therefore, they had to be built from source, and required a lot of debugging.
### Instructions will be added soon!
